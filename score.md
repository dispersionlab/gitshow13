The control for this synth is three LFO modules located on the left most side of the screen. The largest one on the top controls the clock speed for both the sequencer and the turing machine. The other two change several different modulation in the patch.

On the sequencer, there are currently  four tracks to trigger two percussive instruments. The current iteration of recording was played with some swapping between them.
