#score composition:

I have kept all the modules from last patch but I am trying to make a better score than how it was before, a more explicit and informative one.

So, here is how my patch looks like and I will explain what I have changed to produce each sound that you can hear in the recording:

First, I set the LFO-1 Frequency to a little below the middle point and LFO-2 Frequency to the minimum. I LFO-1, The left switch is in the Bipolar state and the right one in the 180 degree. In LFO-2, the Wave switch is set to Unipolar at the beginning. In the mixer that I have shown in the picture, CV4 is connected to the Resonator ODD port at the beginning of the piece.

as the piece starts, I play with the LFO-2 Frequency knob and set it to higher slowly and move it back and forth. I change the Wave switch to Bipolar and back to Unipolar in the same module as well meanwhile.

At ~47, I begin to change the LFO-1 Frequency knob into higher just a bit and leave it. Then I play with the LFO-2 Frequency knob again as I described before.

At ~75, I change the remove the CV4 conncetion with ODD port of resonator and replace it with CV3 port. (CV3 now is connected to ODD) This change will make the sound as you can hear in the recording. I play with the left and right switches in LFO-1 several times and set the frequency to the lowest to end the recording.
