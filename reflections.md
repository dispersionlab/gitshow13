> ## Score:

>-find your flow

>-flip the switches and triggers to change the flow

It is not clear what is exactly meant by switches and triggers. I think there must have been more explanations about what has been done to the patch maybe by the aid of a few pictures. 

>-change streams

Also not clear what are considered as streams and what changes have been made to the patch in order to do that.

As a general reaction to the recording, I would say its most perceptible characteristic was the monotonous clicking glitch sound it has roughly throughout the piece. It fades in when the piece starts and several other sounds are slowly added to the underlying glitch most clearly at 0:17. These short added sounds slowly alternate between right and left audio channels until their frequecy becomes higher most noticeably at 0:53. a few so-called ding sounds appear at 1:02 which prepare the flow to change into a lower frequency and the rhythm is suddenly transformed into a very high frequency one at 1:09,gets back to how it was before at 1:17 and becomes slower and slower until only the underlying glitch is hearable and fades out.

In terms of closeness of the score to the recording, in my opinion, the score is too abstract to describe much about the piece and will not add any information on how the recording has been made to the person who wants to work on the patch next.
